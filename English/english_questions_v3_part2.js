    title: "The Tortoise and the Hare",
    passage: `There once lived a very proud hare who loved to boast about how fast he could run.
He laughed at the tortoise for being so slow. One sunny morning the tortoise grew tired
of the hare’s teasing. “Let’s have a race,” he said calmly. The hare burst out laughing
but agreed, thinking it would be fun to show off again.

When the race began, the hare dashed far ahead and soon could no longer see the tortoise.
Feeling proud, he decided to rest under a shady tree. “I have plenty of time,” he thought,
closing his eyes. The tortoise, slow but steady, kept walking one small step at a time.

Hours passed. The animals along the path cheered the tortoise, amazed at his patience.
When the hare finally woke up and stretched, the sun was already low. He looked toward the
finish line and could not believe his eyes—the tortoise was only a few feet away!

The hare ran as fast as he could, his heart pounding, but it was too late. The tortoise
crossed the line first. Everyone cheered loudly while the hare hung his head in shame.
From that day, he never laughed at the tortoise again. The tortoise smiled and said,
“Slow and steady wins the race.”`,

The villagers trusted him to guard the flock every day. But the boy often felt bored.
To amuse himself, he shouted, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!”

The villagers heard his cry and came running to help, carrying sticks and ropes.
When they arrived, there was no wolf. The boy laughed loudly because he had fooled them.
The villagers warned him not to lie, then returned to their work.

A few days later, the boy did the same thing again. Once more the villagers rushed to help,
and once more he laughed at them. This time they were very angry.

One afternoon, a real wolf appeared from the forest and began to chase the sheep.
Terrified, the boy shouted, “Wolf! Wolf! Please help!” But the villagers thought he
was playing another trick, so no one came. The wolf scattered the flock and disappeared
into the woods.

    passage: `On a small farm lived a Little Red Hen who worked hard every day. She planted vegetables, kept her house tidy, and looked after her chicks. Her three friends—the lazy cat, the dog, and the duck—spent their time sleeping in the sun.

One morning the hen found some grains of wheat. “Who will help me plant these grains?” she asked. “Not I,” said the cat. “Not I,” said the dog. “Not I,” said the duck. “Then I will do it myself,” said the Little Red Hen.

She planted the grains, watered them, and watched them grow tall and golden. When harvest time came, she asked, “Who will help me cut the wheat?” Again, all three refused. So she cut it herself. She carried the wheat to the mill and made it into flour. “Who will help me bake the bread?” she asked hopefully. “Not I,” said the cat, the dog, and the duck together.

The hen baked a warm, sweet-smelling loaf. When her friends smelled it, they ran to her house. “Let us help you eat the bread,” they said. But the Little Red Hen shook her head and replied, “I will eat it myself, since I did all the work.” Her chicks chirped happily as they shared the bread. From that day, the cat, the dog, and the duck promised to help next time.`,

At the top, he found a giant’s castle. Inside, a giantess gave him breakfast but warned, “My husband will eat you if he finds you!” Soon, the giant’s heavy footsteps shook the floor. “Fee-fi-fo-fum!

    title: "The Ugly Duckling",
    passage: `One warm summer morning, a mother duck sat on her nest waiting for her eggs to hatch. 
One by one the eggs cracked open, and out came six yellow ducklings. But one egg was very large and slow to hatch. 
When it finally did, the duckling that appeared was big and gray, not yellow like the others. 
All the farm animals laughed at him and called him ugly.

The poor duckling tried to make friends, but no one wanted to play with him. 
Feeling lonely, he ran away and hid among the reeds by the river. 
As autumn came, the leaves turned golden and the air grew cold. 
The duckling watched flocks of beautiful white birds flying south and wished he could go with them.

Winter was hard. The duckling almost froze in the icy pond. 
When spring arrived, he saw his reflection in the clear water and gasped—he was no longer gray and clumsy. 
He had grown into a graceful white swan! 
When the other swans saw him, they welcomed him warmly. 
The once-ugly duckling spread his wings and joined them, feeling happy and proud at last.`,

The third pig worked hard and built a solid house of bricks.

One day a big bad wolf came by.

When the pig refused, the wolf huffed and puffed and blew the straw house down. 
The frightened pig ran to his brother’s stick house. 
But the wolf blew that one down too.

Both pigs ran to the brick house. 
The wolf tried and tried but could not blow it down. 
Angry and tired, he climbed onto the roof and tried to sneak down the chimney,
